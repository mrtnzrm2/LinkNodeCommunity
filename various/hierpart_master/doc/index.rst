HierPart : a python package implementing the hierarchical partition data structure
==================================================================================

What is **HierPart**?
---------------------

**HierPart** is a python package that implements the *hierarchical partition* data structure [1]_. Furthermore, it can be used to compute the *hierarchical mutual information* between hierarchical partitions.

Hierarchical partitions can be used to represent the *hierarchical community structure* of complex networks. Therefore, the hierarchical mutual information can be used to compare *hierarchical community structures*. In other words, the hierarchical mutual information provides a generalization of the traditional approach, where the standard mutual information is used to compare node partitions, ie., community structures.

    Typically, the idea is compare the performance of different community detection algorithms. For example, a bunch of benchmark tests, in the form of reference networks with planted community structures, are feeded to the community detection algorithms. Then, the *normalized* mutual information is used to compare the community structure identified by each algorithm, with the planted one. A normalized mutual information equal to one, indicates a perfect match, and a value close to zero, a bad result.
