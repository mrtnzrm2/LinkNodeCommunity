A brief description.

The terms *hierarchical partitions*, *trees* or *hierarchical communities*, although, different mathematical objects, for practical purposes, here are used as equivalent terms.

The term *node* should not be confused with the *module* of a *tree*. In some sense, a tree is a network, and as such, it has nodes. However, here, the word *node* is reserved to the elements contained in a hierarchical community structure. To refer to the "nodes" of a tree, it is used instead the term *module*, or equivalents.
