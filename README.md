# Dlink
Dlink is a link community algorithm created to find communities in directed networks with heterogeneous weights.

 ## Introduction
 Welcome everyone! How good of you to spend some time looking at this software. I consider this software an extension of the original link community algorithm (Ahn et al., 2010).
 
 The problem of community detection is profound since it is connected to the problem of data encoding. Each day, millions of bytes of information are saved by governments and companies all around the world. However, all the data is only helpful if you can process it and reveal its structures, symmetries, global features, and laws. Finding communities is like separating the data into homogeneous pieces. In the context of information theory, partitioning the data into clusters can allow you to decode the information faster since the data is arranged correctly, like your clothes when you decide to fold them nicely, which is easier to interpret. Networks in the real world naturally form communities since it is the way to minimize entropy, steps to reach specific information or execute a particular action, a property crucial if the system is under the forces of natural selection.

 There are several community detection algorithms for different network classes. However, finding communities in **dense**, **directed**, **weighted**, and **heterogeneous** networks, as the macaque fraction of labeled neurons (FLN) network (Markov et al. 2011 and 2012), is still an open question since it is not clear what a community representative in such complex systems with many degrees of freedom. Therefore, we started to work on an algorithm to overcome the challenges of identifying communities in this type of network.

Our journey led us to the link community algorithm, which has many essential features, such as assigning nodes to multiple clusters. Nevertheless, to make it work in the FLN network, we had to add several features to the algorithm we listed below. We have baptized the algorithm **Dlink** to distinguish it from the original. However, the new features allow the usage of the algorithm to cortical networks in any directed and simple network (without self-loops and multiple links between the same nodes).

## Link community extension
We had to create new definitions and algorithms to improve the link community algorithm in directed networks. The most important are the following:

1. **Novel link neighborhood concepts**: We introduce novel link neighborhood definitions for directed graphs. Our interpretation diverges from the literature, especially the definition of line digraphs. The new criteria have many graph-theoretical implications that are still undiscovered.

2. **Node community dendrogram**: Link communities, when introduced, were exciting since nodes naturally can be classified into multiple groups. This property is natural in many social, economic, and biological networks. However, node communities are easier to interpret. In the end, either a node belongs primarily to a group or, indeed, it belongs to multiple. Still, following Ockham’s razor, it is essential to have a node community partition first and later specify which nodes live between those communities. We made an algorithm that projects the link merging process to a node merging process, allowing one to obtain a node community dendrogram that significantly simplifies the search for meaningful clusters. This tactic solves the problem since a hierarchy is the data structure that allows nodes to belong to one group at a level or split up into several in another.

3. **Computing similarities using different topologies**: You can choose to find node communities for how similar their source or/and target connections are. In directed networks, nodes can have different functions from the perspective of acting or receiving the action of other nodes. A good partition could differ significantly from how the nodes cooperate with other nodes. Our algorithm can produce partitions considering the direction of interest, making them easier to interpret

4. **Novel quality function ($\mu$-score)**: As it is well known, the concept of a community can have multiple interpretations; however, it is well accepted that the communities tend to be formed by the set of nodes with more connections between them than with the rest of the network. But what happens when the network is so dense that modularity, i.e., the density of a cluster compared to a random network, stops being a good quality function to detect the best partition? To solve that problem, we introduce a new quality function called the $\mu$-score, which spots a partition with a good balance of link communities' sizes. Although the function probably needs improvements, it is a good start toward new alternatives for quality functions in dense networks. Preliminary tests show that in the partitions selected using the $\mu$-score, the algorithm has better sensitivity and specificity in identifying the nodes with overlapping memberships (NOCs) using the LFR benchmarks.

## Why is it different from the rest of the community detection algorithms?


## Pybind11 C++ libraries

The code is implemented primarily in Python (3.9.13), with some C++ libraries used to speed up the algorithm.

The steps to pybind (mandatory) the C++ code are the following:

1. Install **cmake** version [3.24.0-rc4](https://cmake.org/files/). To use CMake, remember to add it to your path.

```
export PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

2. Install pybind11.

```
pip3 install pybind11
```

3. Download the hclust-cpp repository created by [Daniel Müllner](http://danifold.net/) and [Christoph Dalitz](https://lionel.kr.hs-niederrhein.de/~dalitz/data/hclust/).

```
https://github.com/cdalitz/hclust-cpp.git
```
4. Paste the repository in the cpp/process_hclust/src and cpp/la_arbre_a_merde/src.

5. Install the C++ libraries in python by running:

```
pip3 install cpp/simquest
pip3 install cpp/process_hclust
pip3 install cpp/la_arbre_a_merde
pip3 install cpp/rand_network
pip3 install cpp/WDN
```

To create directed, weighted, and possible nodes with overlapping communities, we modified the LFR benchmark from [Andrea Lancichinetti](https://sites.google.com/site/andrealancichinetti/) and [Santo Fortunato](https://www.santofortunato.net/resources) (package 4) to pybind it. The modified code can be seen in cpp/WDN.

## Examples
We have created several examples in Jupyter Notebooks to understand better how to use the algorithm.

- ER_example: Running the algorithm in an Erdos-Renyi random graph with high density. The lack of structure in the node dendrogram shows that the algorithm does not find communities in this null model.

- HRG_example: Explore the algorithm's performance in a sparse directed hierarchical random graph. The most remarkable aspect is that even if the quality functions find different partitions, all the clustering information is encoded in the node community hierarchy. From there, one can read which nodes have a clear modular or overlapping role and the interregional distance between nodes at different hierarchy levels.

- BowTie_example_one: We will show how the algorithm works in a network with a topological NOC. A topological NOC appears because its links belong to two link communities which form two node communities. This situation will split the links into different link communities that sharply contrast with the monotonous membership of the links from nodes that only belong to one community.

- BowTie_example_two: In dense weighted networks, NOCs appear not only because of the lack of connections between groups of nodes but also for a contrasting weighted connectivity profile. The link community algorithm can identify this second type of NOC.

- HSF_example: There are hierarchical scale-free networks besides the traditional hierarchical graphs as denser communities inside sparser ones. This network combines the hierarchical structure with the presence of hubs and the lack of scale, i.e., each level of the hierarchy replicates the level below. We can find the clusters in this complex network using a binary similarity index and Dlink.

## An open end
There is still plenty of work to do. Some of the points to improve are:

- Low computational speed. Currently, the processing of link communities to identify the most exciting partitions is slow and scales as $O(M^{2})$ where $M$ is the number of links in the network. The link-to-node dendrogram projection also scales in the same way.

- The algorithm identifies the NOCs but does not identify the community members they belong to. However, looking at the node dendrogram and link community matrix, one can know which community they belong to.

- There still needs to be a definite way to get the correct node community partition at the best link community. Quality functions' job is to find the best link community partition; however, they do not tell how many node partitions were at that moment. Sometimes, using the node community partition tracked during the hierarchical agglomeration process does not turn in the correct result. We have developed alternative algorithms to find the correspondent node community from a link community. Still, it needs to be clarified when to use them and to do a try-and-error.

- We must check if the link-to-node hierarchy projection algorithm works for undirected networks.
