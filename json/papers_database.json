      "title" :"Wiring cost in the organization of a biological neuronal network",
      "phrases" : [
        "The remarkable feature of this nematode is that most individuals of C. eleganshave almost the same cellular properties such as shapes, connectivities and positions of neurons, which makes it possible to label each neuron",
        "In this issue, a powerful approach is focusing on the high effectiveness of biosystems because of the very essentiality of natural selection in the evolution.",
        "For example, the average distance between two metabolites of 43 microorganisms’ metabolic networks remain the same even though their numbers of nodes span from 200 to 80 [13]",
        "In these models, a total cost is defined as the number of edges (or total length of edges) and the effectiveness is defined by several different measures, e.g. the short characteristic path length. The energy function to be optimized is defined using the cost and the effectiveness measures, and then, by minimizing the energy function, the scale-free network emerges as a result.",
        "Interestingly, the neuronal network of C.elegans shows worse performance than Barabasi–Albert (BA) network [10] and Watts–Strogatz (WS) network [9] with the rewiring probability p ¼ 1:0 [23].",
        "Although the use of the pattern recognition in the Hopfield model as a generic measure of the network performance can hardly be justified, we strongly believe that the clustering coefficient can be a good measure of network performance. In more detail, the large clustering coefficient in a given network implies that there exist many short detouring connections. In the point of view of network performance, we are wasting our precious resources if we make too many triangles in networks since those edges participating in triangles could equally have been used to connect remote vertices. Consequently, the worse performance of the C. elegans neuronal network in Ref. [23] appears to suggest that the performance of the network competes with other measures.",
        "If we are allowed to use as many connections as we want, we can make network functioning very well by using sufficiently many edges. However, putting more edges consumes more resourcesin practice, and thus there should be a trade-off relation between the performance and the cost (measured as the total number of edges in this case).",
        "In this perspective, the cascading failure (the large-scale blackout) in power grid can be understood as the dark side effect of enhancing network performance.",
        "The non-cumulative distribution function P(d),  measuring how many interneuronal connections of the length d exist, is obtained from the derivative of the cumulative distribution with respect to d: the steeper slope in Fig. 2 at small d indicates that there are more shorter connections than longer ones, validating the concept of the wiring cost in the present work.",
        "The second method is the vertex swapping (VS) shuffling method [24], in which two randomly chosen vertices simply exchange their positions while preserving all the connections.",
        "In other words, the original neuronal network can be made to have a smaller wiring cost without changing the connection topology at all by simply changing the neuronal positions. In this regard, it is very interesting to note that if we remove body-spanning long connections of lengths larger than 0.75, the ratio of wiring costs between the original network and the optimized one is changed much from 0.53 to 0.67. This suggests that there are many long-range interneuronal connections that have to be placed without consideration of the wiring cost. Accordingly, if we neglect those long-range connections, role of wiring cost becomes more important in organization of network.",
        "As was discussed above in this paper, we believe that clustering coefficient can detect the network performance in the sense that high clustering in general corresponds to redundant wirings in the network",
        "The clearly observed negative correlation between the two quantities in Fig. 4 implies that wiring cost can only be reduced at the expense of network performance. Accordingly, although the neuronal network can be made more efficient (by reducing clustering coefficient), this can be achieved only by increasing wiring cost.",
        "First, possible reason is the existence of the neuropile, such as nerve ring and ventral cord. If two neurons are connected through these structures, actual wiring may not cost too much although two neurons are separated by a long distance. Second reason one can think of is the functional constraints as mentioned above: the minimal subnetwork topologies for generating certain dynamical behaviors such as oscillation or chaotic motion are identified and named as ‘‘dynamical motifs’’ in Ref. [26], which has shown that some network topologies are unavoidable to perform certain behaviors regardless of wiring cost. One can also argue that full optimization of network structure can hardly be realized in actual biological evolution: the developmental process of every living organism is highly conserved through history of life [27]. Even if C. elegans can minimize the wiring cost by modifying developmental process, this may not happen if the risk of failures in development is too great."

      "phrases" : [
        "Recent work suggests that their structure and fimction are governed by basic principles of resource allocation and constraint minimization, and that some of these principles are shared with human-made electronic devices and communications networks",
        "Because many of these changes are driven by spatial and temporal patterns of neural signals, neuronal netvorks can adapt to circumstances, self-assemble, autocalibrate, and store information by changing their properties according to experience",
        "Economy and efficiency are guiding principles in physiology that explain, for example, the way in which the lungs, the circulation, and the mitochondria are matched and co-regulated to supply energy to muscles (2).",
        "The size of a nervous system can be reduced by reducing the number of neurons required for adequate function, by reducing the average size of neurons, or by laying out neurons so as to reduce the lengths of their connections.",
        "the connections between neurons occupy a substantial fraction of the total volume, and the wires (axons and dendrites) are expensive to operate because they dissipate energy during signali",
        "In chips, the components are arranged to reduce the total length of wiring. This same design principle has been established in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which has 302 neurons arranged in 11 clusters called ganglia.",
        "About 60% of the gray matter is composed of axons and dendrites, reflecting a high degree of local connectivity analogous to a local area network. An ingenious analysis of resource allocation suggests that this wiring fraction of 60% minimizes local delays (10). This fraction strikes the optimum balance between two opposing tendencies: transmission speed and component density.",
        "Unlike the wires in chips, reducing the diameter of neural wires reduces the speed at which signals travel, prolonging delays. But it also reduces axon volume, and this allows neurons to be packed closer to- gether, thus shortening delays.",
        "The thickness of gray matter, just a few millimeters, is nearly constant in species that range in brain volume over five orders of magnitude. The volume of the white matter scales approximately as the 4/3 power of the volume of the gray matter, which can be explained by the need to maintain a fixed bandwidth of long-distance communication capacity per unit area of the cortex (11)",
        "The layout of cortical areas niinimizes the total lengths of the axons needed to join them (12).",
        "The prominent folds of the human cortex allow the large cortical area to be packed in the skull but also allow cortical areas around the convolutions to minimize wire length; the location of the folds may even arise from elastic forces in the white matter during development (13).",
        "If we created a matrix with 101 rows and columns to represent the connections between every pair of cortical neurons, it would have a relatively dense set of entries around the diagonal but would have only sparse entries outside the diagonal, connecting blocks of neurons corresponding to cortical areas.",
        "Thus, only a small fraction of the computation that occurs locally can be reported to other areas, through a small fraction of the cells that connect distant cortical areas; but this may be enough to achieve activity that is coordinated in distant parts the brain, as reflected in the synchronous firing of action potentials in these areas, supported by massive feedback projections between cortical areas and reciprocal interactions with the thalamus (16, 17).",
        "Despite the sparseness of the cortical connection matrix, the potential bandwidth of all of the neurons in the human cortex is around a terabit per second (assuming a maximum rate of 100 bits/s over each axon in the white matter), comparable to the total world backbone capacity of the Internet in 2002 (18). However, this capacity is never achieved in practice because only a fraction of cortical neurons have a high rate of firing at any given time (see below). Recent work suggests that another physical constraint the provision of energy limits the brain's ability to harness its potential bandwidth.",
        "Nervous systems consume metabolic energy continuously at relatively high rates per gram, comparable to those of heart muscle (19). Consequently, powering a brain is a major drain on an animal's energy budget, typically 2 to 10% of resting energy consumption. In humans this proportion is 20% for adults and 60% for infants (20), which suggests that the brain's energy demands limit its size (21).",
        "Energy supply limits signal traffic in the brain (Fig. 2). Deep anesthesia blocks neural signaling and halves the brain's energy consumption, which suggests that about 50% of the brain's energy is used to drive signals along axons and across synapses. The remainder supports the maintenance of resting potentials and the vegetative function of neurons and glia.",
        "From the amounts of energy used when neurons signal, one can calculate the volume of signal traffic that can be supported by the brain's metabolic rate. For cerebral cortex, the permissible traffic is 5 action potentials per neuron per second in rat (Fig. 2) (22) and <1 per second in human (23). Given that the brain responds quickly, the permissible level of traffic is remarkably low, and this metabolic limit must influence the way in which information is processed.",
        "The observation that 1 mm3 of mouse cortex contains 10^5 neurons, 10^8 synapses, and 4 km of axon (24) suggests that, as in chip design, the brain reduces energy consumption by reducing the size and active area of components. Even though axon diameter is only 0.3 mum (on average), sending action potentials along these 'wires' consumes more than onethird of the energy supplied to cortical gray matter (22). Thus, as with computer chips, an efficient layout (discussed above) and a high component density are essential for energy efficiency but, as is also true for chips, miniaturization raises problems about noise.",
        "With respect to miniaturization, stochastic simulations (25) show that channel noise places a realistic ceiling on the wiring density of the brain by setting a lower limit of about 0.1 Fm on axon diameter.",
        "The cortex has many of the hallmarks of an energy-efficient hybrid device (28). In hybrid electronic devices, compact analog modules operate on signals to process information, and the results are converted to digital data for transmission through the network and then reconverted to analog data for further processing",
        "Given that a neuron is a noise-limited device of restricted bandwidth, the information rate is improved with the SNR, which increases as the square root of the number of ion channels, making improve- ments expensive (25).",
        "Given this relationship between noise and energy cost, an energy-efficient nervous system will divide information among a larger number of relatively noisy neurons of lower information capacity, as observed in the splitting of retinal signals into ON and OFF pathways (32).",
        "Energy efficiency is improved when one reduces the number of signals in the network without losing information. In the nervous system, this amounts to an economy of impulses (33) that has the additional advantage of increasing sa- lience by laying out information concisely. Economy is achieved by eliminating redundancy. This important design principle is well established in sensory processing (34). Redundancy reduction is a goal of algorithms that compress files to reduce network traffic.",
        "In the brain, efficiency is improved by distributing signals appropriately in time and space. Individual neurons adopt distributions of f¢ing rate (35, 36) that maximize the ratio between information coded and energy expended.",
        "Networks of neurons achieve efficiency by distributing signals sparsely in space and time. Although it was already recognized that sparse coding improves energy efficiency (37), it was Levy and Baxter's detailed analysis of this problem (38) that initiated theoretical studies of energy-efficient coding in nervous systems.",
        "Sparse coding schemes, in which a small proportion of cells signal at any one time, use little energy for signaling but have a high representational ca- pacity, because there are many different ways in which a small number of signals can be distributed among a large number of neurons. When signals are relatively expensive, it is best to distribute a few of them among a large number of cells. When cells are expensive, it is more efficient to use few of them and to get all of them signaling. Estimates of the ratio between the energy demands of signaling and mainte- nance suggest that, for maximum efficiency, between 1% and 16% of neurons should be active at any one time (22, 23, 38).",
        "The optimum proportion of active cells depends on the ratio between the cost of maintaining a neuron at rest and the extra cost of sending a signal",
        "Does the energy- efficient cortical neuron, like the wise Internet user, select signals from sites that are most informative? This question draws energy efficiency into one of the most active and important areas of neuroscience: synaptic plasticity.",
        "Long-distance communication in the brain oc- curs through all-or-none action potentials, which are transmitted down axons and convert- ed to analog chemical and electrical signals at synapses. The initiation of action potentials in the cortex can occur with millisecond precision (41) but, as we have just discussed, the com- munication at cortical synapses is probabilistic.",
        "Oscillations in the 20- to 80-Hz range occur in the LFPs, and the coherence between spikes and these oscillations has been found to be influ- enced by attention and working memoxy (45)"

      "title" : "Distributed Hierarchical Processing in the Primate Cerebral Cortex",
      "phrases" : [
        "The original notion of hierarchical processing in the visual cortex was put forward by Hubel and Wiesel (1962, 1965) to account for a progressive increase in the complexity of physiological receptive field properties in the cat visual cortex. In particular, they suggested that a serial, feedforward scheme could account for the generation of simple cells from LGN inputs, and complex cells, in turn, from simple cells. Likewise, the properties of hypercomplex cells and even 'higher-order hypercomplex cells' were attributed to inputs from their immediate predecessors.",
        "Our analysis will emphasize that, on the one hand, there is considerable segregation of information flowthroughout the visual pathway; on the other hand, there is also substantial intermixing and cross talk between streams at successive stages of processing.It is likely that these complexities in the anatomical circuitry reflect the multiplicity of computational strategies needed for efficient visual function (DeYoe and Van Essen, 1988).",
        "The demarcation of areal boundaries on the cortical map involved several stages. As noted, a few visual areas were explicitly identified by architectonic criteria in the hemisphere from which the map was made, and the locations of several additional areas were constrained by the pattern of interhemispheric connections that had been determined in this hemisphere.",
        "Connectivity analysis relies on finding a characteristic pattern of inputs and outputs for each cortical area.",
        "Architectonicstelies on a distinctive structure as seen in Nissl, myelin, or other staining techniques. It offers a reliable approach for only a minority of the areas listed in Table 1 and was used to map 3 of the areas (VI, V3, and MT)",
        "In practice, however, the dentification of most areas is based only on a subset f these approaches, often just 1 or 2",
        "To provide a physical perspective for these numbers, it is useful to note that the visual cortex as a whole has about the same surface area as a medium-sized cookie (about 8 cm diameter), while the entire cerebral cortex in one hemisphere corresponds to a large cookie (about 12 cm diameter).",
        "It is apparent that each visual area has many inputs and outputs. Moreover, the particular pattern of connections is distinctive for each area, in terms of the overall constellation of inputs and outputs. In most cases, this pattern provides a characteristic 'fingerprint' that can uniquely distinguish one area from all others. This is particularly true for areas whose connections have been thoroughly studied, such as those in the occipital lobe. Many areas, particularly the recently defined ones, have yet to be studied in detail; hence, our description of the connectional pattern is surely far from complete.",
        "The possibility that the visual cortex might operate by a strictly serial processing scheme can be ruled out just from knowing the multiplicity of connections per area and the near ubiquity of reciprocal connec tions. On the other hand, it seems highly unlikely that the visual cortex is a network that altogether lacks any distinction between processing levels. Many studies, both electrophysiological and lesion based, indicate that some visual areas, such as those in the temporal and parietal lobes, are involved in a higher level of information processing than that mediated by occipital areas such as VI and V2",
        "One hypothesisis that cortical areas are hierarchically organized in some very well-defined sense, with each area occupying a specific position in relationship to all other areas, but with more than 1 area allowed to occupy a given hierarchical level. Another possibility is that a hierarchy exists only in a loose sense, for instance, at the level of the different cerebral lobes, but not in any precisely definable manner for individual cortical areas.",
        "Distinguishing among such possibilities can be pivotal for understanding the operation of any complex system, whether it be in the domain of the cerebral cortex or of human society. It is worth noting in general terms that information flow in a hierarchical system (1) can go in both directions (upwards and downwards), (2) can skip over intermediate levels to go directly from a low to a high level, and (3) can travel in parallel through multiple, functionally distinct channels.",
        "Current ideas about hierarchical organization in the primate visual system were spurred by notions of forward and feedback pathways suggested by connectivity patterns. In particular, Rockland and Pandya (1979) noted that projections in one direction tend to originate from superficial layers and terminate in layer 4, whereas those directed in the opposite direction tend to arise from deep as well as superficial layers and to terminate outside layer 4. They suggested that these 2 directions might correspond to forward and feedback directions of information flow. Subsequently, this notion was used as a basis for proposing an explicit, anatomically based hierarchy of visual cortical areas (Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983).",
        "However, there are a few significant differences that merit explicit mention. Our new version differs from the Van Essen (1985) scheme in having area 7a moved 1 step higher and area DP 1 step lower.",
        "The red lines in Figure 4 indicate the 33 linkages having one or another of the hierarchical irregularities discussed in connection with Table 6. Their presence raises the issue of whether the cortex is inherently only a ''quasi-hierarchical'' structure that contains a significant number (perhaps 10%) of bona fide irregularities and exceptions to any set of criteria that can be devised. Alternatively, the visual cortex might contain an essentially perfect anatomical hierarchy that has been imperfectly studied using inherently ''noisy'' methods of anatomical analysis. Either interpretation is an interesting one, in our opinion, but we doubt that it is possible to obtain a clear-cut answer on the basis of currently available data.",
        "It is very likely that at least a few of the laminar and hierarchical assignments cited in our analysis will change when additional experimental data become available",
        "If one suspects that the underlying biology is extremely orderly, one would predia that the apparent discrepancies listed in Table 6 will largely disappear upon careful",
        "reexamination, thereby improving the overall fit to the hierarchy. This might be accompanied by changes in some of the specific hierarchical assignments. If, on the other hand, one suspects that a hierarchical relationship merely reflects a strong statistical bias, the prediction would be that an increasing number of unambiguous inconsistencies with our scheme will be found.",
        "In terms of connectivity, the great majority of areas that adjoin one another are directly and reciprocally interconnected. There are only a few clear-cut exceptions, such as the reported lack of a connection between ventral area V2 and adjoining areas TF and TH. Thus, while many pathways connect areas that are widely separated within the cortex, it is rare to see adjoining areas that fail to communicate directly with one another.",
        "so we regard the 'anterior signifies upwards' trend to be genuine and perhaps of significance with regard to the way in which the number of visual areas has increased during evolution.",
        "One of these is somatosensory area 7b, which is connected to areas MSTd and MSTp (Andersen et al., 1990) in a way that places it at the eighth hierarchical level. This allows us to link the visual hierarchy with a somatosensory hierarchy that will be discussed below.",
        "The great majority of pathways fit cleanly into ascending, descending, and lateral connections according to the same criteria used for the visual cortex.",
        "Remarkably, the 9 levels of the somatosensorymotor hierarchy are nearly as many as the 10 levels of the visual hierarchy, even though there are fewer than half the number of areas involved.",
        "As already noted, the pathways between the somatosensory and visual systems allow the different modalities to be linked into a unified sensorimotor hierarchy. The configuration of this unified hierarchy can be inferred from examination of Figures 4 and 7 together, but it can also be visualized directly, in a manner that we have illustrated elsewhere (Van Essen etal., 1991). For the most part, each level in the visual system can be matched to a corresponding level in the somatosensory-motor system, and vice versa. This is not invariably the case, however, because area 36 is 3 levels above areas 7a and 7b in Figure 7 but only 2 levels above them in Figure 4. This suggests that one of the intervening somatosensory-motor levels lacks a corresponding visual level, assuming that these hierarchical assignments are indeed all correct.",
        "It is also important to have more information on the linkage between auditory and visual systems. It is known that there are auditory projections to the polysensory, but predominantly visual-association area STP",
        "The remaining regions of the neocortex yet to be incorporated into our analysis include much of the frontal lobe (orbitofrontal, lateral prefrontal, dorsal prefrontal, and medial prefrontal), as well as cingulate, retrosplenial, and insular regions. Many of these regions have strong interconnections with areas near the top of the visual hierarchy, including areas 46 and 7a, and with somatosensory areas, as well",
        "One striking finding is that large paired injections centered in areas 7a and 46 led to interdigitating columnar patterns of terminations in some regions (e.g., cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex), even though the same injections contributed to complementary (ascending and descending) patterns in other regions, such as the STS (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1988). If this observation is confirmed using small tracer injections clearly confined to single cortical areas, it would indicate a clear breakdown in hierarchical relationships.",
        "Thus, there is a strong possibility that substantial portions of frontal and cingulate cortex lie outside the hierarchical framework proposed here for sensory and motor areas.",
        "In summary, a strategy based on laminar connectivity patterns, particularly in the anterograde direction, provides a rational and objective basis for systematically assessing hierarchical relationships throughout the mammalian neocortex. With appropriate refinements in the criteria for distinguishing forward and feedback connections, we have shown that this hierarchy encompasses the full extent of primate visual and somatosensory-motor cortex. However, much remains to be done in order to resolve the modest number of apparent discrepancies and to ascertain just how generally this hypothesis applies across systems and species.",
        "One of the striking features of the visual hierarchy is the extensive degree of parallel processing, as manifested by the presence of many areas at each level in the middle portion of the hierarchy (6 areas at level 5, 7 areas at level 7, and 5 areas at level 8 in Fig. 4). This contrasts sharply with the presence of only 1 or 2 areas at most levels in the somatosensory-motor hierarchy (Fig. 4 vs. Fig. 7).",
        "Malpeli et al. (1981) used reversible inactivation of specific LGN layers to show that about VS of the cells in VI can be activated independently through either the M or the P pathway.",
        "A comparable degree of cross talk persists in the ascending projections leading to the parietal and inferotemporal lobes. V4 projects most strongly to inferotemporal areas, but it also has substantial projections to parietal cortex, directly to VIP and LIP and indirectly through DP, MST, MST1, and MT. Likewise, MT projects heavily to the parietal cortex (directly to VIP and indirectly via MSTd and MST1), but it also has indirect connections with inferotemporal areas via FST and V4. There are also direct connections between parietal and inferotemporal areas (LIP-PITv and 7a-AITd), as well as indirect linkages by way of FST, STP, and frontal lobe areas.",
        "We have concentrated in this study primarily on an anatomical analysis that suggests 5 key principles of primate cortical organization: (1) a large number of visual areas, (2) highly distributed connectivity among areas, (3) reciprocity of connections, (4) hierarchical organization, and (5) distinct, yet intertwined, processing streams.",
        "Whether each level of the hierarchy represents a distinct stage of information processing is a separate issue that must be addressed mainly by physiological and behavioral approaches.",
        "One type of physiological evidence in support of the hierarchy comes from comparisons of receptive field size, as conventionally plotted using moving bars or edges (the 'classical' receptive field). In VI, receptive fields are typically very small, and they increase progressively at successive stages of the hierarchy, ultimately approaching the entire visual field in extent in some of the inferotemporal and parietal areas (cf. Van Essen, 1985, for references). Ideally, one would like to know whether these increases occur in stepwise fashion at each hierarchical stage. However, such information is not readily attainable, given that several factors contribute to differences in receptive field size, including a strong dependence on eccentricity, plus effects of anesthesia and of interanimal variability.",
        "emergent receptive field properties at progressively higher levels of the hierarchy.",
        "(1) Many cells in V2, but not in VI, are responsive to patterns that elicit percepts of subjective contours in human observers (Peterhans and von der Heydt, 1989; von der Heydt and Peterhans, 1989). (2) Some cells in MT, but not in VI, are selective for the motion of a complex pattern rather than the individual oriented components (Movshon et al., 1986). (3) Some cells in the inferotemporal cortex are selective for faces or other complex patterns (Desimone et al., 1984; Baylis et al., 1987; Perrett et al., 1987; Saito et al., 1987).",
        "Physiological distinctions between processing streams are evident from the outset, in that M and P channels differ markedly in how they represent information information along spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions (cf. Shapley and Perry, 1986; Lennie et al., 1990). At any given eccentricity, P cells, on average, have smaller receptive fields and higher spatial resolution, whereas M cells have higher temporal resolution, higher contrast sensitivity, and a lower absolute threshold.",
        "These differences suggest an overall strategy in which the M and P channels handle distinct, but partially overlapping, portions of an information space that includes the dimensions of space, time, and spectral composition (Van Essen and Anderson, 1990).",
        "In a more general sense, there appears to be a complex, but orderly, relationship between low-level sensory cues (e.g., orientation, velocity, disparity, and spectral composition), high-level aspects of perception (e.g., perception of shape, surface qualities, and spatial relationships), and the processing streams that generate one from the other (DeYoe and Van Essen, 1988)."

      "phrases" : {
        "Introduction" : [
          "However, recent advances, which are summarized in this Review, suggest that such simplification is no longer tenable because the majority of interactions in highly interconnected systems, especially in biological systems, are multiplicative and synergistic rather than additive.",
          "Perhaps the best-known skewed distribution in neuroscience is the Weber–Fechner law, which postulates that the response to a sensory stimulus, such as light or sound, is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus amplitude (4,5).",
          "A random variable that is the sum of many independent variables has an approximate normal distribution (as stated in the central limit theorem). Likewise, a random variable that is the multiplicative product of many independent variables has an approximate lognormal distribution (this is justified by the central limit theorem in the log domain).",
          "However, a lognormal distribution has a finite mean and variance, in contrast to power low distribution of scale-free systems. Distinguishing lognormal and power law distributions is important for understanding their biological origin.",
          "The goal of this Review is to show that skewed distributions of anatomical and physiological features permeate nearly every level of brain organization.",
          "An important consequence of the skewed distribution of brain resources is that a selected minority (say “10 percent”) of neurons can effectively deal with most situations (by which we mean brain states and environmental (place) changes but also context and other manipulations, such as novelty). However, to achieve 100% accuracy 100% of the time requires a very large fraction of brain networks to cooperate.",
          "Brain oscillations as expressed by scalp EEG at the macroscopic level, and the activity of neuronal networks as reflected by the local field potential (LFP)11 at the mesoscopic level form a system that spans several orders of magnitude of time12,13 (FIG. 1a). They are coupled in a hierarchical manner, in which the power of a faster oscillation is modulated by the phase of a slow oscillator12,14–16.",
          "The firing rates of principal cells of every region in the cerebral cortex investigated to date have a lognormal or lognormal-like rate distribution",
          "However, it may be argued that such distributions are an artefact due to methodological issues; indeed, each recording technique has some caveat.",
          "During global remapping, there seems to be a relatively ‘orthogonal’ or randomsample relationship between population firing-rate vectors in the different contexts, such that a minority of neurons discharge at comparable rates in both contexts, whereas the remaining neurons are relatively silent in one context and active in another39,42.",
          "Furthermore, the log firing rates of individual neurons during slow-wave sleep in the home cage and those during subsequent exploration in a novel environment show a reliable positive correlation",
          "The preserved rate correlations across states, testing environments and even novel experiences, suggest that the firing-rate distribution in cortical populations is relatively ‘fixed’ when longer timescales are considered and are more strongly controlled by factors intrinsic to internal network dynamics than by transient external factors.",
          "The relatively stable rate dynamics of cortical neurons raise several questions: how do such stable networks encode information? Do neurons at the opposite ends of the distribution have different intrinsic biophysical properties and wiring patterns (discussed in the next section)? And can slow-firing neurons become fast ones, or vice versa?",
          "Numerous indices of hippocampal place cell firing — such as within-session stability, place field coherence and information rate — are positively correlated with firing rates19, suggesting that fast-firing principal neurons are more stable and convey information more reliably than slow-firing neurons.",
          "Imaging place cells over several weeks and months has demonstrated that the place fields of ~20% of the population remain stable over that period, whereas the remaining ~80% may lose their place features56. Although firing rates were not reported in these long-term experiments, one can assume that the ‘place-stable’ neurons belong mostly to the fast-firing minority as there is a reliable relationship between rate, bursting and calcium influx57.",
          "Even if we assume that the axon arbors and synaptic contact probabilities with downstream neurons are similar for fastfiring and slow-firing neurons, the fast-firing minority (which also bursts more) may have a larger effect than the slow-firing majority because faster-firing cells can contribute more spikes in a given time window than can slow-firing neurons.",
          "Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that bursts of spikes affecting the same synapse within <10 ms are often more effective than larger numbers of inputs on different dendrites of the same neuron30,58.",
          "suggesting that the fast-firing minority may form a special, highly active subnetwork or ‘hub’.",
          "It is important to note that although stronger connections among small groups of neurons may be associated with faster firing rates, model networks of either random or complex synaptic connectivity can give rise to a skewed, long-tailed distribution of firing rates63–68.",
          "Thus, stronger synapses are not only stronger on average but are also more reliably strong from event to event. Recent computational studies suggest that a skewed distribution of synaptic strengths between participating neurons may be a critical factor in sustaining lognormal firing rate distribution68,76",
          "In these studies, a few large-amplitude and stable synaptic connections seemed to dominate the entire model network because removal of the weak synapses had little impact on population firing, and when all synapses were equalized to a ‘mean’ strength, a much larger number of neurons had to be stimulated by external inputs to maintain stable activity68. Thus, the bulk of the information flow may be routed primarily through a web of strongly connected neurons.",
          "The efficacy of spike transmission is highly variable across pairs of cortical neurons and has a skewed, lognormal-like distribution — the majority of pairs are weakly coupled and a small minority are strongly coupled19",
          "However, when STDP works in a synaptic weight-dependent manner (called log-STDP83), it can produce a skewed weight distribution and sustain stable network dynamics83.",
          "Whether the postulated log-STDP rule is operative in the brain remains to be demonstrated.",
          "It is noteworthy that these structural–functional features may not be exclusive properties of cortical circuits: motor unit sizes in the spinal cord also show a lognormal pattern93",
          "Thus, it is possible that specific constellations of interneuron innervation of single principal cells may also contribute to variations in the firing rate of pyramidal cells.",
          "a minority of strong afferents are mixed with large numbers of weak inputs, so that the connectivity profile of the area is best described by a lognormal distribution100. These findings in monkeys also apply to the mouse brain",
          "Furthermore, the findings support the view that lognormal rules of connectivity can combine the advantages of local computation and global (top-down) control, synchronization, wiring economy, information storage and communication speed2,68,103,104. These new anatomical observations, therefore, are highly relevant to the often-discussed multimodal and multisensory neurons in various parts of the brain and to the computation of multisensory integration105.",
          "The macroscopic connectivity scheme can also provide clues about the relationship between the skewed firing-rate distributions and local–global communication: although fast-firing neurons with strong connections in a given circuit can respond effectively in most situations, the slow-firing neurons of the global connectome could be equally important. The global or ‘contextual’ activity provided by slow-firing neurons may constrain the effectiveness of ‘specific’ communication.",
          "In conclusion, it seems that the lognormal rule applies to various functions, from local circuits to systems of the brain connectome. Larger-diameter axons can provide faster communication, have larger terminal arbors112 and typically originate from neurons with high firing rates113. It is thus tempting to speculate that the skewed distribution of cortical connections forms the morphological substrate for the log rule of macroscopic brain dynamics, as reflected by the LFP and EEG.",
          "The experimental data reviewed above demonstrate that synaptic strength, neuronal firing rate, population synchrony and information content of spikes show a skewed distribution, and this is associated with a lognormal distribution of spine size and connections at the large-scale level of the brain connectome.",
          "What makes these distributions potentially important is not so much the fact that skewed distributions are found at multiple levels but that these skewed distributions might be linked across the multiple levels. Neuronal firing patterns in numerous cortical areas in various species show a common theme: a small minority of strong synapses and fast-firing neurons provide a substantial portion of the activity in all brain states and situations, and information may spread along the trajectories of these strongly connected and highly active neurons. However, the rest of the brain is not silent; the remaining part of neuronal activity in any given time window is supplied by very large numbers of weak synapses and slow-firing cells. The divisions ‘strong’ and ‘weak’, and ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ are not absolute, as a continuous — rather than bimodal — distribution characterizes both brain activity and its supporting anatomical structure.",
          "A lognormal distribution may be the result of a combination of genetically defined ‘scaffolding’ and experiencedependent modification of synaptic strengths, biophysical properties and anatomical wiring; and the quantitative features of the lognormal distributions of several measures of neural activity and connectivity may differ across cortical areas, layers and neuron types.",
          "Importantly, despite a degree of rigidity in terms of network statistics and structure, members of the slow-firing majority of neurons, which have more-plastic properties, can provide sufficient flexibility for dynamic neural coding.",
          "A theoretical implication of the skewed distribution pattern is that the distinction between signal and noise inevitably becomes fuzzy. Synapses and neurons at the left and right tails of the distributions may seem to serve different functions, but there is no clear boundary between their postulated functions. A practical implication of the absence of a clear boundary is that comparing morphological and dynamic variables (for example, firing rate) with Gaussian distribution-based statistics is not justifiable.",
          "The problem of proper sampling of the weak majority (that is, the left tail of the lognormal distribution) is a general issue and may contribute to the appearance of power laws in many models",
          "What is the relationship between the two ends of a continuous distribution that can span several orders of magnitude? A highly active and bursting minority of neurons, potentially supported by strong synapses in a preferentially connected subnetwork, may be responsible for nearly half of the spikes in any time window. his end of the distribution may serve to provide fast, economic and highly efficient but perhaps less-precise communication12,104",
          "Although this is currently a speculative idea, such high-firing and strongly connected neurons with faster-conducting axons may support a ‘rich-club’ organization in the brain, in which a minority of neurons, with stronger connectivity, have access to more information than the majority of neurons and share such information among themselves116",
          "As there is no definable boundary between the two ends of the distribution, the boundary between local and global connectivity117,118 is vague. In networks with such local–global interactions, optimal performance is characterized by a trade-off between computation speed and accuracy.",
          "A common observation is that the activity of just a dozen or so strongly firing neurons is often more informative about an animal’s behaviour than that of the remaining majority of neurons that is being recorded simultaneously28,30,121–123. Similarly, in brain–machine interface applications, just 10–20% of task-related neurons can predict as much as 60–80% accuracy of limb position or gripping force, and adding further information from the remaining majority of taskrelated neurons improves the prediction only by a modest 10–15%124,125. Thus, it seems that a ‘backbone’ consisting of the fast-firing minority of neurons in a strongly connected network provides a ‘best guess’ for matching behaviour to environmental situations.",
          "The large quantity of weak synapses may also represent a reservoir for memory storage. In addition, the slow-firing majority of neurons may serve to provide excitation to interneurons and thereby secure a sufficient level of inhibition to counter the effects of the fast-firing minority of excitatory neurons115 and maintain self-organized, sustained activity in the cerebral cortex.",
          "Networks with skewed statistical properties have been shown both to provide a broad dynamic range and to offer stability, resilience and tolerance to component failures68,75,127. Another major advantage of logarithmically linear computation in both electronic circuits and biochemical systems is its energy efficiency128,129, and this efficacy probably applies to brain circuits as well.",
          "Another fundamental feature of cortical circuits is feedforward inhibition130, and numerous experiments suggest that division is accomplished by dendritic subtraction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are encoded logarithmically, followed by exponentiation through active membrane conductances67,76,131–136.",
          "Even a non-experienced brain can have numerous high-probability states (often referred to as attractors140) that can give rise to distinct constellations of neuronal firing (so-called ‘trajectories’ (REFS 121,141)), each of which is available to represent a unique event or situation119",
          "Each situation — novel or familiar — activates the appropriate highest-probability state, and this matching process reflects the ‘best guess’ of the brain. From this perspective, there is no ‘unknown’, as every situation is able to activate one of the pre-existing trajectories on the basis of generalization from past experience. Such preconfigured connectivity and firing patterns, which are initially driven by the strongly connected and fast-firing minority of neurons, may explain why the spatiotemporal structures of spontaneous and evoked activity are often similar46–48,78–81 and why spontaneous activity can be predictive of activity evoked by an experience even when the experience is novel (a phenomenon known as preplay)19,45",
          "However, the large reservoir of the weakly connected majority of neurons lends itself to modifications, and as a result of these modifications, initially similar trajectories may become distinct from each other. From this perspective, learning and experience are largely a fast-matching and slower refinement process.",
          "In summary, the brain can generate a large number of states that can determine the spatiotemporal evolution of neuronal activity. Experience becomes embedded into these pre-existing states (attractors) and modifies them with repetition so that the attractor states acquire ‘meaning’ by representing external inputs and events81,145.",
          "In summary, although ‘10%’ of highly active neurons can provide remarkable solutions in most encounters, optimal performance requires the commitment of a very large fraction of the brain through a very low level of engagement. A full understanding of the origin and biological utility of the multiscale, log-dynamic organization of brain function requires systematic work at the experimental, modelling and theoretical fronts. Perhaps the biggest challenge is to reveal how the lognormal form of connectivity and firing dynamics relates to the log scaling of the hierarchical nesting of multiplexed brain rhythms148 and to the Weber–Fechner law of our senses."
